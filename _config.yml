# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Software developer with over 15 years of experience in **full-stack** web

  deeply in finding the simplest-possible solution, and iterating over it until
  an elegant, joy-eliciting solution emerges. Passionate about clean, readable
  code that communicates intent, _test-driven-_ and _behavior-driven-design_,
  and clean user interfaces.
