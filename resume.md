## Summary

I caught the software programming bug in 2003 and have been coding every chance
I get ever since. I am a full-stack web developer with a particular passion for
back-end and Javascript frameworks. My projects are live today, being used to
solve real-world business problems. I subscribe to the old adage, "Find
something you love to do and you will never work a day in your life," and feel
blessed to have found "that something." My mind and temperment are well-suited
for logically working through problems and coming up with elegant solutions.

## Projects && contributions

### Catering Manager, 2004—present

**Stack**: Ruby on Rails 5.2, Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, AWS, Digital
Ocean, Docker, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu Server

**Private repo; please contact me for access.** Catering Manager is a
real-world application, in production use today, used by Orlando's
catering and La Perla Ballroom, which generates customer-facing quotes
(in .pdf format), books and tracks events, and is used by staff for
organizing events.

### [Scheduler](https://github.com/fapapa/scheduler), November 2019

**Stack**: Node, Express, PostgreSQL, React, Jest, Cypress

Scheduler is a *single-page application* built with React. I also implemented a
set of features that use web-sockets to update one user's view when another user
modifies the schedule.

### [Bufala Online Order & Pickup](https://github.com/SunnieBB/hungry-people), October 2019

**Stack**: Node, Express, EJS, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, Twilio
API

Bufala is a real restaurant for which my team and I built a fictitious online
order-and-pickup system for our mid-term project at Lighthouse Labs. It is
comprised of a customer-facing component, a restaurant-facing component, an
SMS-sending to create a great experience for both.

### [Tweeter](https://github.com/fapapa/tweeter), October 2019

**Stack**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node, Express, EJS, SASS

Tweeter is a clone of the popular social media juggernaut, completed as part of
the Lighthouse Labs course work.

### [File Server](https://github.com/fapapa/file-server), October 2019

**Stack**: Node, net library, fs library

A Lighthouse Labs **stretch** project (to be attempted only by more advanced
students in free time) to build a rudimentary file server and client.

### [ISS Spotter](https://github.com/fapapa/iss_spotter), October 2019

**Stack**: Node, Express, API's (IPify, IPVigilante, OpenNotify)

This Lighthouse Labs project chains together three API's to automagically
display the next flyover dates and times of the *International Space Station*
over the user's airspace. It was a great way to explore promises (and the async
nature of Javascript) without using async/await.

### [TinyApp](https://github.com/fapapa/tinyApp), September 2019

**Stack**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, EJS

TinyApp is a clone of a URL shortening service, built as part of the Lighthouse
Labs Web Development course. I added extra features that were not part of the
standard course work, allowing a user to track their shortened URLS and access
basic analytics.

### [BarChart](https://github.com/fapapa/bar-chart-js), September 2019

**Stack**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery

BarChart is a Javascript library that allows you to generate bar charts for
display on websites. This was an optional *stretch project* for my pre-course
prep work for Lighthouse Labs, completed by only a handful of students that have
taken the bootcamp.

### [GitLab - merge request !29718](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/29718), June 2019

**Stack**: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL

In this contribution to the FOSS project, GitLab, I added a requested feature
that adds a preference to allow maintainers to create subgroups, instead of
having to ask the owner of the group to create the subgroup, giving developers
the option to be more agile. This contribution garnered me the title of *MVP of
the release*, and a $150 gift certificate!

### [GitLab - merge request !29511](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/29511), June 2019

**Stack**: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL

I fixed an issue where, when pushing a repository to a new and default branch,
the commit messages would not get processed for issue references, which was
stopping some users of competitive products from switching to GitLab. I picked
this issue to help me learn about the overall architecture of GitLab and because
it was an interesting business problem.

### [Compiler](https://gitlab.com/fapapa/nand2tetris-course/tree/master/projects/11), April 2019

**Stack**: Ruby

I wrote a compiler in Ruby from scratch that compiles *Jack* code into VM
language. It does *syntax analysis* and *code generation* to turn the high-level
code into a stream of tokens that are then converted into VM commands.

### [GitLab - merge request !25942](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/25942), March 2019

**Stack**: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL

Simply a matter of deleting some unnecessary lines and updating the unit
tests. I wanted to get a flavour for installing GDK and stepping through the
workflow of squashing bugs and adding features, while lowering Gitlab's
technical debt.

### [VM Translator](https://gitlab.com/fapapa/nand2tetris-course/tree/master/projects/08), March 2019

**Stack**: Ruby

I wrote a VM translator in Ruby that converts virtual machine code into
assembly. This helped me to understand the nature of call stacks in programming
and how it relates both to higher-level languages and to assembly instructions.

### [Assembler](https://gitlab.com/fapapa/nand2tetris-course/tree/master/projects/06), March 2019

**Stack**: Ruby

I wrote an assembler in Ruby that converts assembly code into machine code.

### [JackDoku](https://gitlab.com/fapapa/nand2tetris-course/tree/master/projects/09/JackDoku), March 2019

**Stack**: Jack (a Java-like programming language created for the Nand to Tetris
Course)

I wrote a Sudoku game for the *Nand to Tetris* course, including a graphics
library for writing sprites of arbitrary size to any location on the screen.
