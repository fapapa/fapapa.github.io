<h2 class="project">Hack assembler</h2>
<img alt="Two files side-by-side; a hack file and the same file after being

<p class="description">

  In this project for the <a
  href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer" title="Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris">
  Coursera Nand2Tetris course</a>, I write an assembler, which takes a given
  program in Hack assembly, and converts it to Hack machine code. Machine code
  is the combination of raw binary bits that a processor can take as
  instructions for a program. It is exceptionally tedious to read or write a
  program in machine code, as you must encode and decode 0's and 1's and exactly
  where they need to go to execute the instruction you want. Assembly is has a
  one-to-one correlation to machine code (each line of assembly is one
  instruction), but it is symbolic and therefore much easier to read and write
  for us mere mortals. However, the computer needs instructions sent to it in
  machine code, so the assembler does the work of converting assembly language
  to machine code.
